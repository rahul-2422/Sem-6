Node 1: Color 1
Node 2: Color 2
Node 3: Color 3
Node 4: Color 4
Node 5: Color 5
Node 6: Color 6


Node 1 sends Color 1 to Nodes 2 and 6
Node 2 sends Color 2 to Nodes 1 and 3
Node 3 sends Color 3 to Nodes 2 and 4
Node 4 sends Color 4 to Nodes 3 and 5
Node 5 sends Color 5 to Nodes 4 and 6
Node 6 sends Color 6 to Nodes 5 and 1


Node 1 receives Colors 6 and 2 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 6, so it forwards 6 to its neighbors.
Node 2 receives Colors 1 and 3 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 3, so it forwards 3 to its neighbors.
Node 3 receives Colors 2 and 4 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 4, so it forwards 4 to its neighbors.
Node 4 receives Colors 3 and 5 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 5, so it forwards 5 to its neighbors.
Node 5 receives Colors 4 and 6 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 6, so it forwards 6 to its neighbors.
Node 6 receives Colors 5 and 1 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 6, so it forwards 6 to its neighbors.


Node 1 receives Colors 6 and 3 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 6, so it forwards 6 to its neighbors.
Node 2 receives Colors 1 and 4 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 4, so it forwards 4 to its neighbors.
Node 3 receives Colors 2 and 5 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 5, so it forwards 5 to its neighbors.
Node 4 receives Colors 3 and 6 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 6, so it forwards 6 to its neighbors.
Node 5 receives Colors 4 and 1 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 4, so it forwards 4 to its neighbors.
Node 6 receives Colors 5 and 2 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 5, so it forwards 5 to its neighbors.

Node 1 receives Colors 6 and 4 from its neighbors. The maximum color is 6, so it declares itself the leader and sends a message to its neighbors indicating this.

The final state of the ring network is:

Node 1 (leader): Color 1
Node 2: Color 2
Node 3: Color 3
Node 4: Color 4
Node 5: Color 5
Node 6: Color 6
